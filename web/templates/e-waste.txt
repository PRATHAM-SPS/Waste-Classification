E-Waste:-

Recycling: Many components of electronic devices, such as metals, plastics, and glass <br>, 
can be recycled. Contact your local recycling facility to see if they accept e-waste and what their guidelines are.

Donating or Selling: If your electronic device is still functioning, consider donating or selling it. This will prevent it from being added to the waste stream and provide a usable item for someone else.

Manufacturer or Retailer Take-Back Programs: Many electronic manufacturers and retailers offer take-back programs for their products. Contact the manufacturer or retailer to see if they have such a program and what the guidelines are.

Certified E-waste Handlers: Some organizations specialize in the proper disposal of electronic waste. These organizations have the equipment and training to safely handle and dispose of e-waste. Contact your local waste management authority or environmental agency for a list of certified e-waste handlers in your area.

It is important to note that electronic devices should not be thrown in the regular trash, as they contain toxic chemicals that can leach into the environment and harm human health.

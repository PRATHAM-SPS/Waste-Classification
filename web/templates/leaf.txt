                                                Leaf Waste:-

Composting: Leaves are an excellent source of carbon-rich material for compost. 
You can create a compost pile in your backyard and mix in the leaves with other organic material, 
such as kitchen scraps, to create nutrient-rich compost for your garden.

Mulching: Mulching leaves involves chopping them into small pieces and spreading them on your lawn or garden beds.
This helps to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and add nutrients to the soil as the leaves decompose.

Curbside Collection: Many cities and municipalities offer curbside leaf collection services in the fall. 
Check with your local waste management authority to see if they offer this service and what the guidelines are.

Yard Waste Disposal: If your city or municipality doesn't offer curbside collection, you can bring your leaf waste 
to a yard waste disposal facility. These facilities accept leaves, grass clippings, and other yard waste for composting 
or other forms of disposal.

Burning: Burning leaves should be a last resort, as it can create air pollution and be a fire hazard. 
Check with your local authorities to see if leaf burning is allowed and what the guidelines are.

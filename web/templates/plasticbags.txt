                                                Plastic Bags:-

Recycling: Many recycling facilities accept plastic bags. However, it is important to note that plastic bags 
can cause issues at recycling facilities if they are not properly prepared. Check with your local recycling 
facility to see if they accept plastic bags and what the guidelines are.

Reusing: Plastic bags can be reused multiple times for shopping or other purposes. 
This can help to reduce the amount of plastic waste that is generated.

Donation: If you have extra plastic bags that are in good condition, consider donating them to a local food bank
 or other organization that can use them.

Trash Disposal: If recycling or reusing is not an option, plastic bags can be disposed of in the regular trash. 
However, it is important to note that this is not an environmentally friendly option, as plastic bags take a long 
time to break down in a landfill and can harm wildlife.

It is important to note that plastic bags should not be recycled in curbside recycling bins or thrown in the trash. 
This can cause harm to wildlife and the environment. Instead, plastic bags should be properly prepared for recycling, 
reused or donated, or disposed of in the regular trash. Additionally, reducing the use of plastic bags by bringing 
reusable bags when shopping is a great way to reduce plastic waste.
